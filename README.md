# plantcv-dev-scripts

This repository contains PlantCV analysis scripts that are/were in development. These scripts are in various stages of development and may not work with the current version of PlantCV. Scripts that end up being used in a manuscript get moved to a manuscript-specific archival repository (e.g. https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv-setaria-molplant).
